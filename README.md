# READ ME
### FOR HOMEWORK A
I created a flower field by modifying the previous flower grid, where the size, size variation, rotation speed, rotation direction, color, and position are partially or entirely determined by random numbers (num and direction). Initially, I tried using the random() function directly inside the draw() function, but I found that it caused changes in every frame, which didn't achieve the effect I wanted. After consulting GPT, I set the random numbers in the setup() function and stored them in an array, then called the previously stored random number data in the final loop that generates the flowers, which allowed for random variation in the flowers. I also added mouse movement and click interactionsâ€”moving the mouse changes the position and size of the flowers, while clicking reruns setup() to generate more flowers.
### FOR HOMEWORK B 
I tried to copy Wall Drawing #65 (1971),which is lines not short, not straight, crossing and touching, drawn at random, using four colors, uniformly dispersed with maximum density, covering the entire surface of the wall.But I didn't relize it wasn't all made by straight line till I started to write READ ME, and I don't know how to make curves random in that form, so I copied another one, which is Wall Drawing #17 (1969),Four-part drawing with a different line direction in each part.
